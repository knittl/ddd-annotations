DDD Annotations
===============

This project defines annotations to help projects implementing [Domain Driven Design](https://www.domainlanguage.com/).
Annotating classes and other code artifacts provides documentation to developers, without having to taint identifiers
with suffixes such as "Entity", "Repository", or even "VO". All annotations are also automatically added to the JavaDoc
of each element.

All annotations are documentation-only annotations and can be added to any new or existing project.
